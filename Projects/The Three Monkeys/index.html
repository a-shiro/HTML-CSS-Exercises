    <h1>SEE NO EVIL</h1>

    <p>
      I became fascinated with the concept of speak no, see no, hear no evil. And - and the actual depiction of three
      wise monkeys. And I began collecting it over the years. And I kind of figured that I might be the - the fourth
      monkey, the feel no evil monkey.

    <h1>HEAR NO EVIL</h1>

    <p class="col-2-description">
      Ideas come from ordinary, everyday life. And from imagination. And from feelings. And from memories. Memories of
      dust in my sneakers and humming whitewalls down a hill called Monkey.

      expression of seriousness which would do credit to any college student, but the monkey is serious because he
      itches
